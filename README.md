# Real-time PDR System

A real-time Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) system designed to track and estimate the trajectory of a pedestrian using sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers.

## Overview

The Real-time PDR System harnesses the power of IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors to provide continuous navigation information without reliance on external signals such as GPS. It is particularly useful in indoor environments or urban areas with limited GPS availability.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Tracking**: Instantly processes sensor data to update the pedestrian's location.
- **Multi-sensor Integration**: Utilizes data from accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers for enhanced accuracy.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Can be adapted to various platforms and use cases.
- **Robust Algorithm**: Implements a sophisticated algorithm to filter noise and provide reliable positioning.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the Real-time PDR system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuyyyuuu/Realtime-PDR.git
   ```

2. **Build the Project**
   - Import the project into your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and build the project according to the IDE's instructions.

3. **Run the System**
   - Execute the main class to start the real-time PDR system.
